Running an NFS server in a Docker container on a Windows machine using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) can be tricky because Windows and Linux handle paths differently, and Windows doesn't natively support Linux's /etc/exports file or NFS. Here’s a clear guide to resolve this issue and get the setup running locally.

Step-by-Step Instructions for VS Code on Windows
1. Pre-Requisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Docker Desktop:

Install Docker Desktop on Windows and ensure it uses the WSL2 backend.
Enable "Linux containers" mode (not Windows containers).
Download Docker Desktop.
Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2):

Install a Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu) via the Microsoft Store.
Follow the WSL2 setup guide.
Visual Studio Code:

Install the Remote - WSL extension from the VS Code marketplace.
2. Set Up the Project in WSL2
Open VS Code in WSL:

Open VS Code and connect to the WSL2 environment.
Use the "Remote - WSL" extension to open a folder in the WSL file system.
Create the Project Structure: Inside your WSL terminal, create the project folder:

```bash

mkdir nfs-service && cd nfs-service
Create the Required Files:
```

Dockerfile:

```bash
FROM debian:latest

# Install necessary NFS packages
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    nfs-kernel-server \
    nfs-common \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Create directories
RUN mkdir -p /etc/secrets /jobfile-run

# Add the setup script
COPY setup_nfs.sh /usr/local/bin/setup_nfs.sh
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/setup_nfs.sh

# Expose ports for NFS
EXPOSE 111/udp 2049/tcp

ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/setup_nfs.sh"]
setup_nfs.sh:
```

```bash

#!/bin/bash

# Load secrets and create users
if [ -f /etc/secrets/nfs_users ]; then
    while IFS=: read -r username password; do
        if ! id "$username" &>/dev/null; then
            useradd -M -s /usr/sbin/nologin "$username"
            echo "$username:$password" | chpasswd
        fi
    done < /etc/secrets/nfs_users
fi

# Ensure the export directory exists
mkdir -p /jobfile-run

# Configure exports
echo "/jobfile-run *(rw,sync,no_root_squash)" > /etc/exports

# Start services
rpcbind
service nfs-kernel-server start

# Keep the container running
tail -f /dev/null
```

docker-compose.yml:

```yaml

version: '3.9'

services:
  nfs-server:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    network_mode: host
    volumes:
      - jobfile-run:/jobfile-run
      - ./secrets:/etc/secrets:ro
      - /var/lib/nfs:/var/lib/nfs
      - /etc/exports:/etc/exports
    privileged: true
    secrets:
      - nfs_users

secrets:
  nfs_users:
    file: ./secrets/nfs_users

volumes:
  jobfile-run:
  ```
Makefile:

```bash 
#Makefile
secrets:
    @mkdir -p secrets
    echo "user1:password1" > secrets/nfs_users
    echo "user2:password2" >> secrets/nfs_users
```
3. Configure the Windows Environment
Ensure Necessary Directories Exist on Host
In the WSL terminal, create the following directories and files:

```bash

sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/nfs
sudo touch /etc/exports
```
4. Build and Run the Service
Generate Secrets: Run the Makefile to generate the secrets file:

```bash

make secrets
```
Build the Docker Image: Use Docker Compose to build the image and start the container:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
Verify NFS Server: Check the NFS exports:

```bash

showmount -e localhost
```
You should see /jobfile-run exported.

5. Mount NFS Share
On a Linux client (or within WSL2), mount the NFS share:

Create a mount point:

```bash

sudo mkdir -p /mnt/jobfile-run
Mount the NFS export:
```
```bash

sudo mount -o vers=4,nolock localhost:/jobfile-run /mnt/jobfile-run
```
Test access:

```bash
ls /mnt/jobfile-run
```
6. Troubleshooting
Error: /etc/exports not recognized
Ensure the file /etc/exports exists in the WSL2 environment.

Error: NFS permissions denied
Ensure the container is running in privileged mode and the export is configured correctly.

Summary
This setup leverages WSL2 for compatibility with Linux-based NFS operations, ensuring /etc/exports and other kernel-level resources function correctly. You should now have an operational NFS server that is accessible locally and can handle file sharing as per your requirements.
