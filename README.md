# 1.Creating a Dockerfile for the NFS Service
The Dockerfile will install the NFS server, configure it, create users based on the provided secrets, and ensure the necessary directories are created.

# 2.Create the Secrets Directory and File
You mentioned the use of make secrets to generate secret files. For simplicity, we assume make secrets will generate a users.txt file that contains the list of users to be created.

The example of how secrets might be structured:
secrets/users

# 3.Update the docker-compose.yml
You need to update the docker-compose.yml file to include the new NFS service. 
This will also include mounting the NFS share and adding the necessary secret files.

docker-compose.yml

# Build and Start the Container:
```sh
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

# 4.Ensure the NFS Server is Running and Accessible
Once the NFS server is up and running, the other services can connect to it. To test connectivity:

Start the NFS server by running the docker-compose up command.
Verify the NFS mount from another container (e.g., service1) by connecting to the container and checking the mount:
```sh
docker exec -it service1 /bin/bash
mount | grep /jobfile-run
```
You should see the NFS mount /jobfile-run listed, which shows that the NFS share is being accessed.




# 5.Testing the Setup
Build the Docker images with docker-compose build.
Bring up the services using docker-compose up.
Verify that the NFS server is running, and check if other services are able to access the /jobfile-run directory.



# Important to be noted to check
The users.txt file in the secrets directory can be modified as needed, with each line containing a username to be created.
Ensure proper network configuration for the NFS server to be accessible to the other services.
This example assumes a basic NFS setup; you may need to adjust NFS settings (e.g., permissions, export configurations) based on your security and access needs.

# Verify NFS Server:
From another container or the host (assuming your host can reach the Docker network), you can mount the NFS share:

```sh
docker run -it --rm \
  --network docker-compose_nfs-network \
  --volume nfs-server:/jobfile-run \
  ubuntu:20.04 \
  bash -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y nfs-common && mount -t nfs n
```

This command will start an Ubuntu container, install nfs-common, mount the NFS share, and list the contents to confirm connectivity.




# Ensure Directories are Created
This is handled within the Dockerfile by creating the /jobfile-run directory.








-------------------------------------
Another Approach
Create a Dockerfile
Here's an example of how your Dockerfile might look to create an NFS server with the necessary setup:

Dockerfile


FROM ubuntu:20.04

# Install necessary packages
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y nfs-kernel-server && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Create directories for NFS mount points
RUN mkdir -p /jobfile-run

# Copy secrets files
COPY secrets/ /etc/nfs-secret/

# Add users from secrets if not present (this assumes your secrets file lists users)
COPY scripts/add_users.sh /scripts/add_users.sh
RUN chmod +x /scripts/add_users.sh && \
    /scripts/add_users.sh

# Configure NFS exports
RUN echo "/jobfile-run *(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)" >> /etc/exports && \
    exportfs -ra

# Expose the NFS port
EXPOSE 2049

# Start the NFS server
CMD /sbin/service nfs-kernel-server start && tail -f /dev/null



----------------------------------
2. Create the Secret Files
You'll need to create a script (make secrets) to generate secret files. Here's a simple example:

Makefile
secrets:
    @echo "Creating secrets..."
    @echo "user1:/usr/sbin/nologin" > secrets/users.txt
    @echo "user2:/usr/sbin/nologin" >> secrets/users.txt
----------------------------------------------------
3. Script to Add Users (add_users.sh)
Create a script to add users based on the secrets file:

bash
#!/bin/bash
while IFS=":" read -r username _; do
    if ! id "$username" &>/dev/null; then
        useradd -s /usr/sbin/nologin "$username"
    fi
done < /etc/nfs-secret/users.txt
---------------------------------------------------

4. Update Docker Compose File
Here's how you might update your docker-compose.yml to include the NFS server service:

yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  nfs-server:
    build: 
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    volumes:
      - nfs-data:/jobfile-run
    secrets:
      - users.txt
    networks:
      - nfs-network

volumes:
  nfs-data:
    driver: local

secrets:
  users.txt:
    file: secrets/users.txt

networks:
  nfs-network:
    driver: bridge
----------------------------------
5. Ensure Directories are Created
This is handled within the Dockerfile by creating the /jobfile-run directory.

6. Show Connection to NFS Server
To test if you can connect to the NFS server:

Build and Start the Container:
sh
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d

Verify NFS Server:
From another container or the host (assuming your host can reach the Docker network), you can mount the NFS share:

sh
docker run -it --rm \
  --network docker-compose_nfs-network \
  --volume nfs-server:/jobfile-run \
  ubuntu:20.04 \
  bash -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y nfs-common && mount -t nfs nfs-server:/jobfile-run /mnt && ls /mnt"

This command will start an Ubuntu container, install nfs-common, mount the NFS share, and list the contents to confirm connectivity.

Notes:
Ensure your Docker host has NFS client capabilities installed if you're mounting from the host itself.
The nfs-server in the mount command refers to the service name in the Docker network, which Docker resolves to the correct IP.
Adjustments might be needed based on your specific network setup or additional security requirements like firewall rules.
